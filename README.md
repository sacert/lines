Lines - Just a placeholder name (I guess)

Haven't coded anything in awhile, time to make something. Planning on creating a site with modules (bloging, image uploades, etc) that I can add to.
For the most part, it will likely just be a type of blogging platform that I can learn things on since I don't have many web-type projects.

Framework:

Ruby on Rails cause that is what I'm using at work, will help with learning it better.

To Do:

- Implement the basics of a blogging platform
- I would like to add some form of an image uploading module to mess around with the storing/indexing of images
- Something related to elastic search cause that is everywhere and I pretty much know nothing about it
